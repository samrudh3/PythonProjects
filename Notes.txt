Break will be used to come out of the loop 
continue is used when we have skip a itration in the loop

Functions= block of code performs specific task
Argumennts : Default Args, keyword args, Variable len args, Required args

List - collections of any data type
List Comprehension
m = l (if m is effected l will also effect)

k = l + m (if m and l are effected, k will not get effected, concatinates the list)
Syntax : [Expresion(item) for item in range() if(Condition)]

Tuple = Immutable
